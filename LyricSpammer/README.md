This program, written for an April Fool's Day prank, can be used to email the
contents of a file to your friends (or enemies) one line at a time. I've attached
some song lyrics to get you started.

To execute, fill in your GMail username and password as indicated in the
comments in LyricsSpammer.py. Important: You need to allow your Google account
to use "Less Secure Apps." Instructions on how to do so are linked below. Have fun!
