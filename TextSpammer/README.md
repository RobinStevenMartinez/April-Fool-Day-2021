# TextSpammer.py

With TextSpammer.py, you can text entire files to your friends, line by line.
To get started, run the program and quickly move your cursor to your
iMessage or GroupMe text bar and right-click. You will have two seconds after
starting the program before lines begin printing.

Be careful! The program will continue printing lines until it is terminated
manually or until it reaches the end of file——irregardless of where the cursor
is placed.

In this repo you'll find some text files to get you started. Have fun!
